# Auricl Studios — Full-Cast AI Audiobook Platform

## Executive Summary
We’ve built an end-to-end, full-cast AI audiobook production platform that reduces costs from $6–20K to **<$300** per title. The system transforms any PDF into a fully acted audiobook with character voices, acting directions, and music—delivered in hours, not weeks.

## Market Opportunity: $11B Growing 26% Annually
- Traditional audiobook production: $6–20K per title  
- Our AI platform: **<$300** per title (~98% cost reduction)

**At a glance**
- Modular, agent-based architecture with strict input/output schemas  
- Multi-provider TTS abstraction (e.g., Hume, ElevenLabs, OpenAI)  
- Parallelized orchestration and resumable execution  
- Config-driven model selection and failover

## Phase Overview

### Phase 1 — PDF Extraction
OCR with chapter/section structure detection and layout preservation. Robust to complex page designs; preserves narrative flow for downstream segmentation.

### Phases 2–3 — AI Character Intelligence
Extracts named characters/aliases, salient traits, and relationships from raw text. Enriches each character with personality archetypes, speech/voice hints, and interaction graphs. **Output**: a Character Registry used by downstream agents for attribution, voice selection, and direction.

### Phase 4 — Voice Configuration & Casting
Automated voice casting against a provider-agnostic layer (e.g., Hume Octave TTS, ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS). Character-to-voice mapping with fallbacks for coverage and timbre diversity. Produces stable **Voice Profiles** (IDs, parameters, speaking pace, expressivity).

### Phase 5 — Dialogue Segmentation (Orchestrated)
Our v2 orchestrator performs scene splitting, script segmentation, and **speaker attribution** at scale. Handles interruptions, asides, multi-party overlaps, and context-aware dialogue refinement. Attaches **acting directions** (emotional cues, delivery style) to each segment.

### Phase 6 — Audio Generation & Music Integration
**TTS Generation**: Uses provider-selected voices to render dialogue and narration segments.

**Music Agent (AI Music Director)**  
- Scene grouping (~45s or ~10 segments typical) using metadata and dialogue content  
- Context analysis across speakers, acting directions, and sentiment to choose mood-matched music: *mysterious, suspenseful, melancholic, ambient, dramatic* (or none)  
- Non-intrusive mixing: typical music bed at ~15–35% of dialogue level, with 1–3s crossfades and seamless looping to match scene length  
- Fail-safes: if analysis confidence is low, default to **no music** for intelligibility  

**Normalization**: Gentle normalization, dynamic range control, and gain limiting to maintain clarity and comfortable listening levels.

### Phase 7 — Assembly & Mastering
Assembles segments into chapters and a complete book with metadata tagging. Applies final normalization to consistent levels for professional distribution. Produces logs and a decisions report (scene boundaries, music choices, quality notes).

## Design Principles & Modularity

**Clear interfaces**  
- Typed, schema-validated objects between agents; strict separation of content understanding (LLM) and signal processing (audio tooling).

**Provider and model abstraction**  
- Pluggable voice providers; centrally configured models; tiering by task complexity, latency, and budget.

**Parallelization & resilience**  
- Scene-level parallel work; persisted intermediates for resumability; graceful degradation (fallback voices, skip-music mode).

**Quality controls**  
- Acting-direction consistency checks, speaker continuity checks, and per-scene loudness targets; corridor limits on music gain and fades to maintain dialogue primacy.

## Music Agent: Behavior & Policy

**Inputs**: Scene-grouped segments with speaker labels, text, and acting directions.

**Logic**
1. Scene analysis to infer mood from dialogue content and emotional cues  
2. Mood mapping to curated library (*mysterious, suspenseful, melancholic, ambient, dramatic*) or **none**  
3. Mixing policy: background at 0.15–0.35 of dialogue level; 2–3s fade-in/out; 1s crossfades; seamless looping  
4. Failure modes: on missing assets or low confidence, proceed without music and log the rationale

**Outputs**: Final mastered audio, machine-readable **music decisions report**, and a processing log.

---

## Operations & Deployment Considerations
- **Throughput**: Scene-level batching plus parallel workers achieve practical real-time multiples on book-length inputs.  
- **Cost discipline**: Tier models by task complexity; cache intermediates; enable skip modes.  
- **Observability**: Track per-phase timings, error rates, retries; log music decisions and normalization deltas.  
- **Content safety**: Provider safeguards plus internal filters for toxic content prior to rendering.

---

## Typical User Flow
1. Ingest a PDF and run extraction with structure preservation.  
2. Build a Character Registry (extraction + enrichment).  
3. Configure voices and validate suggested matches.  
4. Segment into scenes; attribute speakers; attach acting directions.  
5. Generate TTS for all segments.  
6. Integrate music via the Music Agent; apply normalization and fades.  
7. Assemble chapters and export the mastered audiobook with metadata and reports.

## Roadmap (Selected Enhancements)
- Adaptive pacing for pauses, breaths, and overlap in multi-voice scenes  
- Style transfer: persistent delivery style per character across chapters  
- Interactive review: web-based diff and punch-in replacement for targeted fixes  
- Parallel scene render: global prosody coordination across concurrent scenes

---

## Notes on Uncertainty
- **Cost** (<$300/title) varies with provider pricing and book length; **80–90%** confidence under current usage patterns and caching.  
- **Latency** depends on provider/API concurrency and network; **70–85%** confidence on “hours, not weeks.”  
- **Music mood inference** is statistical; pipeline defaults to **no music** when confidence is low to preserve intelligibility.
